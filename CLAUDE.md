This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a comprehensive "Vibe Coding" training repository containing materials for multiple training formats:
- **Starter (1 day)**: Introduction to AI-assisted programming with Cursor and other tools
- **Master (3 days)**: Advanced agentique development and Context Engineering
- **Collective (5 days)**: Team-based training materials

## Training Philosophy

This repository is designed around the "Vibe Coding" methodology:
- **Vibe Coding**: AI-assisted programming using LLMs through structured prompting
- **Context Engineering**: Advanced techniques for optimizing AI interactions  
- **Agent-based Development**: Using specialized AI agents for different development phases

## Key Training Concepts

### AI Tools Covered
- Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, WindSurf, Kilo Code, Continue, Replit
- Focus on prompt engineering and AI-human collaboration workflows

### Frameworks and Methodologies
- **BMAD-METHOD**: Collaborative planning framework
- **SuperClaude/CCPM**: Spec-driven development approach
- **MCP (Model-Controller-Prompter)**: Bridge between AI and external tools

## Course Materials

### Starter Course (1 day)
- **File**: `Starter − 1 day/VibeCoding-starter.md`
- **Language**: French
- **Focus**: Introduction to vibe coding concepts, basic prompt engineering, simple exercises
- **Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge, VSCode, Cursor installed

### Master Course (3 days) 
- **File**: `Practice − 3 days/VibeCoding - Mastering - 3-days.md`
- **Language**: French
- **Focus**: Advanced agentique development, Context Engineering, security considerations
- **Format**: Day 1 = Starter content, Days 2-3 = Advanced concepts

## Development Guidelines

### Working with Training Materials
- Preserve the pedagogical structure when making modifications
- Keep documentation in French as this is a French training program
- Respect the progressive difficulty from Starter → Master → Collective
- Update version numbers and dates when making significant changes

### File Modifications
- Always backup before modifying course materials
- Maintain consistency between different format versions (PDF, MD, DOCX, etc.)
- Test any referenced tools or links in the materials

## Excluded Files
- `.DS_Store` files (macOS system files)
- Large files referenced in `.gitignore`

When working with this repository, prioritize maintaining the educational integrity of the training materials while helping improve content clarity and updating outdated information about AI tools and techniques.
